  <p> My name is Erick Ventura, I am from El Salvador. My favorite sports to play is Soccer, Basketball, and Volleyball. My favorite hobby is to draw and play games. I really love to eat Pupusas<br> My other hobby is to exlpore abandoned places especially exploring abandoned train stations. It is something i really really find very fun and interesting. MY favorite place to ever go is El Salvador since the people over there are so nice and the places i have gone are amazing and although they take a while to arrive there its worth the time. </p>

    <!-- 5. After the third sentence in your bio, add a break tag. -->
